# Photography Portfolio Website

## Project Features & Interest

Welcome to my personal photography portfolio website! During the summer I travelled to several countries in Asia, including South Korea, Japan and China, where I was given the chance to practice and explore my passion for photography. Every image you'll see displayed on the site was captured on my Sony a7 IV camera, paired with the Sigma 24-70mm F2.8 lens. After returning home, I wanted to find a way to share and showcase some of my favourite pictures with you, which lead to the creation of this website! It served as an wonderful and fun introduction to web development/design for me. The website is fully responsive for all devices and I built it using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
